      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Gamepad API provides a tightly scoped interface to gamepad devices
      and is focused on the most common elements of those devices, namely axis
      and button inputs. It specifically excludes support for more complex
      devices (e.g., those that do motion tracking or haptic feedback).</p>

      <p>However, some uses of gamepads rely heavily on those more advanced
      features. This supplemetary spec describes extensions to the base API to
      accommodate those use cases. If they prove to be broadly useful, the hope
      is that they will be eventually merged into the
      <a href="./">main spec</a>.</p>

      <h2><dfn>GamepadHand</dfn> Enum</h2>

      <h2><dfn>GamepadHapticActuator</dfn> Interface</h2>
      <p>
        A <code>GamepadHapticActuator</code> corresponds to a configuration of
        motors or other actuators that can apply a force for the purposes of
        haptic feedback.
      </p>

      <pre class="idl">
        interface GamepadHapticActuator {
          readonly attribute GamepadHapticActuatorType type;

            The <code>playEffect(type, params)</code> method, when invoked, must return
            a new Promise <var>promise</var> and run the following steps in
            parallel:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Validate that the effect parameters in <var>params</var>
            describe a valid effect of type <var>type</var>. The validity
            may depend on the type of effect specified. If the effect is
            invalid, resolve <var>promise</var> with <var>'invalid-parameter'</var>
            and abort these steps.
          </p>

            2. If the current page is not visible, resolve <var>promise</var> with

          </p>
          <p>
            4. If the effect type is not compatible with the haptic actuator type,
            resolve <var>promise</var> with <var>'not-supported'</var> and abort
            these steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Issue the haptic effect to the actuator.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. After the effect is complete, resolve <var>promise</var> to

            The <code>reset()</code> method, when invoked, must return

          </p>
          <p>
            3. Issue the reset command to the actuator to stop vibration.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Once vibration is stopped, resolve <var>promise</var> to
            <var>'complete'</var>.

        <dt>Page visibility</dt>

      <h2><dfn>GamepadHapticActuatorType</dfn> Enum</h2>
      <p>
        The actuator type describes the capabilities of the gamepad's
        haptics configuration.
      </p>

      <pre class="idl">
        enum GamepadHapticActuatorType {
          "dual-rumble"

        <dt><dfn>dual-rumble</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Dual-rumble describes a haptics configuration with an eccentric
          rotating mass (ERM) vibration motor in each handle of a standard
          gamepad. In this configuration, either motor is capable of vibrating
          the whole gamepad. The ERM masses are unequal so that the effects of
          each can be combined to create more complex haptic effects. A device
          may expose a vibration actuator with type <code>'dual-rumble'</code>
          if it has a dual-ERM configuration, or if it has an alternate haptics
          configuration that is compatible with dual-rumble effects.

      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><dfn>GamepadHapticEffectType</dfn> Enum</h2>
      <p>
        The effect type defines how the effect parameters are interpreted by
        the actuator.
      </p>

      <pre class="idl">
        enum GamepadHapticEffectType {

        <dt><dfn>dual-rumble</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
        <p>
          A dual-rumble effect is a fixed-length, constant-intensity vibration
          effect intended for an actuator of type <code>'dual-rumble'</code>.
          Dual-rumble effects are defined by four parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <var>duration</var> sets the duration of the vibration effect in
          milliseconds, default 0. A negative <var>duration</var> is considered
          invalid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <var>startDelay</var> sets the duration of the delay after
          <code>playEffect()</code> is called until vibration
          is started, default 0. During the delay interval, the actuator must
          not vibrate. A negative <var>startDelay</var> is considered invalid.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent abuse, the user agent may consider an
          effect invalid if the total effect duration (the sum of the vibration
          interval and delay interval) exceeds some maximum duration.
          A maximum of 5 seconds is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          <var>strongMagnitude</var> and <var>weakMagnitude</var> set
          the vibration intensity levels for the heavier and lighter ERM
          motors, normalized to the range <code>[0,1]</code>, default 0.
          Values outside of this range are invalid.

        A <code>GamepadEffectParameters</code> dictionary contains keys for
        parameters used by haptic effects. The meaning of each key is defined
        by the haptic effect, and some keys may be unused.
